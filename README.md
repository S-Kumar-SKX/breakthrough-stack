# Breakthrough Stack

> Quietly building. Focused on solving what truly matters.

This is a personal lab — open, evolving, and raw.  
I’m working on long-term ideas in AI, computing, energy, and space.  
No background in elite schools or companies. Just curiosity and consistency.

### What I’m exploring

- Building AI from first principles  
- Efficient, scalable computing systems  
- Future energy models beyond today's limitations  
- Foundational space tech

### Structure

- `src/` – Code, experiments, and prototypes  
- `research/` – Notes, thoughts, and questions  
- `blog/` – Occasional reflections and progress logs  
- `roadmap.md` – Strategy and direction

### Why this exists

There’s a lot of noise out there. This is signal.  
A place to build with clarity, not for validation — but for impact.  
No rush. Just the long game.

Would you like me to move on to `roadmap.md` next, or would you prefer a first blog post or research note?
