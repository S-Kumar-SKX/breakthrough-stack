# Roadmap

This isn’t a traditional roadmap.  
It’s a compass — built on obsession, not deadlines.

## Phase 1: Groundwork

- Learn and document AI fundamentals (ML, deep learning, LLMs)
- Understand the limits of today’s computing systems  
- Explore energy systems — from fusion to alternatives to batteries  
- Learn Git, open-source workflows, and publish consistently  
- Build online presence (GitHub, Twitter) — not for attention, but connection

## Phase 2: Projects & Experiments

- Build small, sharp tools in AI (data labeling, model tuning, etc.)
- Release research notes and theory-based projects openly
- Contribute to meaningful open-source projects  
- Launch experimental repos (e.g., AI tools, minimal chips, fusion models)

## Phase 3: Scale and Collaborate

- Create a scalable framework or product (could be an AI API, energy sim, etc.)
- Reach out to people solving the same problems, not chasing hype  
- Apply for wildcard opportunities (grants, fellowships, wild entry points)

## Long-Term Direction

- Create a foundation that can support research without permission  
- Work on what can still be considered impossible  
- Build in public until it’s undeniable

Not here to replicate. Here to rethink.
